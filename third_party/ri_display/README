This is a source code for Houdini display driver plugin for Pixar's RenderMan.

RenderMan 20.2 and up ships with Houdini display driver (d_houdini), so
this source code is provided as a reference or in case it needs to be 
extended in some way.

This display driver allows RenderMan to render images directly to MPlay
window via 'mdisplay' utility that abstracts the communication interface.
In other words, RenderMan will render into the same window that Mantra
renders into.

To build the plugin, you can use the provided SampleMakefile as a 
starting point. You may need to edit the INCEXTRA variable to contain the
boost include directory in order to compile:

    make -f SampleMakefile install
    
Additionally, ri_hinstall.unix and ri_hinstall.win scripts can be used
to configure RenderMan to use the compiled Houdini display driver plugin.
They need to be run in the plugin's directory. They modify the rendermn.ini
file in the home directory.
